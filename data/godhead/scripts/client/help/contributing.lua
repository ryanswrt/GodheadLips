We are looking for contributors. We especially need gentlemen who enjoy arts such as 3D modeling, sound engineering, and quest writing. Coders interested in writing gameplay scripts in Lua are also needed badly. We can certainly find something to do for other people too so the lack of work isn't an obstacle at least.]]}}}
